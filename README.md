This program was created after I obtained my school's substitute portal login (this allows me to change absences for literally anyone). Their whole system
is poorly designed and has 0 security. The password was PVEC, so really anyone could have guessed this. Anyway I got it because some old lady subsitute didn't know
how the system worked so I helped her. Through helping the lady I discovered the login and the great amount of power that came with it. I mean come one at least design the system
so only teachers who have a substitute can be accessed or maybe even flag when there are hundreds of requests from the same ip.

Since marking everyone absent manually is a task that would require clicking about 8000+ buttons I decided to automate it in python as a little challenge.
The program logs into every single teacher in the school, then iterates through every single class they teach and marks every single student absent.
The program was simple enough to complete because once again they had zero security (maybe I have given them the incentive to change that).
The code is pretty clear so if you want to know exactly how it was done have a read.
