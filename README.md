This program was created after I obtained my school's substitute portal login (this allows me to change absences for literally anyone). Their whole system
is poorly designed and has 0 security. The password was PVEC, so really anyone could have guessed this. Anyway I got it because some old lady subsitute didn't know
how the system worked so I helped her. Through helping the lady I discovered the login and the great amount of power that came with it. I mean come one at least design the system
so only teachers who have a substitute can be accessed or maybe even flag when there are hundreds of requests from the same ip.

Since marking everyone absent manually is a task that would require clicking about 8000+ buttons I decided to automate it in python as a little challenge.
The program logs into every single teacher in the school, then iterates through every single class they teach and marks every single student absent.
The program was simple enough to complete because once again they had zero security (maybe I have given them the incentive to change that).
The code is pretty clear so if you want to know exactly how it was done have a read.

Actually running the program and my regrets:
Program is almost perfect unfortunately I am an impulsive thinker and didn't think twice when setting up a proxy
I could have just downloaded proton vpn to get away with it but I wanted to be fancy and use a stupid little free
proxy which aren't even safe in the first place and are slower also they almost never work.

PROTON VPN !

I'm very disappointed in myself. I haven't learned a single lesson as I would do it again if I could. All that I have learned is my brain is not as
good as I thought it was. Everyone makes mistakes but this is just stupid and disappointing. Nothing about this was impressive if I got caught.

No point in robbing a bank if you got caught (slightly different situation but point is clear).

Why would I make an assumption that the proxy would just immediately work in the code if I activated it on my system.
I always extensively test programs but not in time when it really mattered. I am now suspended for 5 days, I don't care, it doesn't affect me.
My pride is just hurt because I got caught doing a cool thing in a stupid way.

Also the whole idea of the program was testing my abilities and staying anonymous is a big part of it. I could of used this as an opportunity
to learn proxy chains (proxies connecting to other proxies before connecting to the actual request).

This is definitely the first time this has ever happened and likely the last. Not because they changed the password and I am locked out forever, Im sure I could get in again but
I feel like I would be a clear suspect. There will always be some old substitute that needs help logging in. Maybe they will change the system to not allow for this ever again. Anyway this
likely will never happen again in the history of PVEC, not because I believe they will improve the system but because I wont ever do it again.

Getting caught in a way was a good thing, that's why you're reading this. I can also share the story without the fear of getting caught (because I have been).
