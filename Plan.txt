Program layout plan:

Program will login to a teacher loop through every class mark every student absent
then login to the next teacher in the list and repeat until every student is absent

login phase (step 1):
-create a list for every teacher and their ID
-loop login

entering attendance (step 2) :
-Once logged into a teacher loop through every attendance button and access the href
-need to access the href while still keeping the session active (or can just return back to previous page)
-once in attendance information will need to be gathered for the post request
-students are assigned as a code which is inside the page source and can be retrieved
-lots of other information will either not be neccecary or can be found in the url

posting absence (step 3, final step):
- once all the information is gather we simply need to send it to the attendance post url
-after this either go to the next class or sign out and login to the next teacher (To signout add ~loff add the end of url)

This project will likely take some time.

New means they are currently a present student
MOD means they are currnet absent (could also mean late or left early idk yet)
COM would be the comment under their absence (could possibly make this say something cheeky)
Lots of information is inside of the url, student names/ids is within page source (label = tr).

note ideas:
Where the fuck my blunt? Where the fuck my cup? Where the fuck my reefer?
